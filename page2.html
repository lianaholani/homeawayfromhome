        <p class="bedrooms">Home Away From Home is a place to stay at when youre away from yours. For many, it is considered more of a home than a bed and breakfast. Home Away From Home is a two story building that 
            offers 6 rooms all with different themes. Out of the 6 rooms, there is one room accessable for those with disabilities. Each room is big enough for five people. There 
            is also a set of rooms that connect to eachother which makes it perfect for a bigger party along with kids.</p>

          <p class="garden">Outside, there is a beautiful garden that surounds the building. This area is open for those who want to take a liitle stroll or just get some fresh air.
            The garden is well taken care of and many visitors love to take pictures with the beautiful scenery. It is a perfect compliment for the building. Right next to the garden is 
            a little lawn area that offers seating, benches, and picnic tables. This is great for having lunch outside while the children run around. Overall it is a safe, fun, and cozy environment
